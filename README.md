# CountYourHits
Count your Hits Playing games where you have to hit targets is a popular leisure activity. Crucial, and sometimes frustrating facts for beginners, can be 

(i) the complex calculation of the final scores, or

(ii) due to large distances the impossibility to see the hits on the target especially when they are close together

The goal of this thesis is the development of a smartphone based App that uses image processing methodologies and existing libraries to be capable of
calculating the overall points, representing the hitting â€“ pattern visually (including the highlighting of the latest hits) and transmit it over a network to a defined server to have the data at remotely coupled places.

The developed App should finally be tested on one selected application domain (e.g., Darts, Bowling, etc.)
